# Installing OKEngine on Hermes

OKEngine = **a pinned Hermes** + **12 carried patches** + an **overlay** (new
files) + **plugins** + **config**, then **one pack or bundle**. This is the procedure
to take a stock Hermes install and bring it up to OKEngine — i.e. the exact
stock→OKEngine delta.

**Pinned dependency:** Hermes **v0.18.2** = upstream git tag **`v2026.7.7.2`**
(`github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent`). The engine is cut against this version;
a different Hermes version may require rebasing the patches.

Prereqs: Docker, git, a host user. `HERMES_UID`/`HERMES_GID` **default to your own uid**
(`$(id -u)`), so a pack you cloned as yourself just works — nothing to export. Pin a
**fixed** uid (and `chown` the tree to it) only for a vault you'll move between hosts or
operate as several users:
```bash
export HERMES_UID=10000 HERMES_GID=10000 && sudo chown -R 10000:10000 <pack>   # portable/shared only
```

## Run it with Docker (start here)

Most users never touch §1–§8 below — **`deploy.sh` runs the whole stock→engine delta** (clone
Hermes → apply `patches/` → overlay → `docker build`) on first run, then brings the stack up:

The block below is paste-able end to end — it builds the **okpack-cti** cyber-threat-intelligence
stack (a composed bundle: adversaries + vulnerabilities + landscape + indicators + detections +
incidents). Swap in any pack from `framework.py list` at step 2. The only line you must edit by
hand is the model key at step 4.

```bash
# 0. Prereqs: Docker + git + Python 3 with PyYAML.
sudo apt-get install -y python3-yaml || python3 -m pip install --user pyyaml

# 1. Clone the engine (the overlay + image build source).
git clone https://github.com/jalewis/OKEngine.git okengine

# 2. Fetch a domain pack into a SIBLING vault dir (engine and vault stay side by side).
#    Browse alternatives with: python3 okengine/scripts/framework.py list
python3 okengine/scripts/framework.py pull okpack-cti okcti
cd okcti

# 3. Activate ingest. Packs ship feeds/feeds.opml EMPTY (deliberately inert) —
#    skip this step and the stack runs but pulls NOTHING.
cp feeds/feeds.opml.example feeds/feeds.opml

# 4. Add a model key: edit .env and set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
#    or DEEPSEEK_API_KEY (the one step you can't paste).
cp .env.example .env

# 5. Build the image (once), start gateway/reader/mcp, deploy the crons, verify —
#    then POPULATE the vault now (ingest -> compile -> dashboards -> brief).
bash ../okengine/scripts/deploy.sh --kickstart
```

Completing these five steps yields a **working, populated system**: `--kickstart` walks the whole
build fleet once in dependency order (feed ingest + every pack importer → compile → entities →
graph → dashboards → brief) so the wiki and dashboards fill immediately instead of waiting out the
schedule (feeds ~2h, dashboards daily, brief weekly). It spends model budget — drop the flag if
you'd rather let the schedule fill the vault over its first day. Review `feeds/feeds.opml` after
copying: the example list is a *suggestion* — prune or add sources to taste (some example feeds
are intermittent; see `docs/cold-start-checklist.md`).

**Where to look once it's up.** Base ports are reader `9200` / cockpit `9201` / MCP `8730`, plus
the pack's port offset — a pack pulled with `--port-offset N`, or a bundle recipe that sets one,
adds N to each. **okpack-cti's recipe sets offset 200**, so the block above lands at:

| UI | URL (okpack-cti) | Base (offset 0) | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Reader** | `http://localhost:9400` | `:9200` | browse/search the wiki, page detail + backlinks, agent Chat |
| **Cockpit** | `http://localhost:9401` | `:9201` | the function-oriented dashboard: briefings, watchlists, data tabs |
| MCP (read) | *(no host port)* | *(bridge-only)* | the agent's query API — reached by the gateway at `okengine-mcp:8730` by service name; NOT published to the host by default (the skeleton compose host mapping is commented out). Publish it only for an external MCP client — then a token is required and `401` without one is healthy. |

Both UIs bind to `OKENGINE_BIND` (default `127.0.0.1` — this machine only). To reach them from
another machine on your LAN, set `OKENGINE_BIND=0.0.0.0` in `.env` **and** set the real passwords
there, then `docker compose up -d` again (deliberate choice — see the `.env.example` comments).

To make a network-exposed deployment safe without hunting through the individual flags, set
`OKENGINE_HARDENED=1` in `.env`. It is a **fail-closed** profile: the daily in-gateway
`deployment_validate` lane FAILs (and shows ERRORED in fleet health) until every unsafe setting is
fixed — a real `OKENGINE_MCP_TOKEN`, reader auth (`OKENGINE_READER_PASSWORD`) or an explicit
`OKENGINE_TRUST=public`, rate limiting on, exports off for a public reader, and **UI editing off**
(`OKENGINE_EDITING=0` — the reader Chat can otherwise write back to the vault). It never mints
secrets for you; it tells you exactly what to set. See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

**§1–§8 below are the by-hand internals** that `build-engine-image.sh` + `deploy.sh` automate —
read them to build manually, debug a build, or rebase patches on a Hermes bump.

## Fast path — build the gateway image (automates §1–§3)

The gateway container image (`hermes-agent`) = pinned Hermes + the patches +
the engine overlay, baked to `/opt/hermes` (where `config.yaml` points the
`okengine-write` MCP server). OKEngine is an *overlay*, not a Hermes fork, so it
has no root Dockerfile — one script assembles the tree and builds the image:

```bash
bash scripts/build-engine-image.sh          # clone Hermes@pin -> patch -> overlay -> docker build hermes-agent
#   HERMES_SRC=/path/to/hermes  bash scripts/build-engine-image.sh   # reuse a checkout
#   SKIP_BUILD=1                bash scripts/build-engine-image.sh   # assemble tree only (inspect/CI)
#   TAG_LATEST=0                bash scripts/build-engine-image.sh   # build the version tag only — DON'T move a :latest other stacks share
```

> **Overlay code changes only go live after an image rebuild.** The overlay files
> (`tools/schema_validator.py`, `okengine-mcp/`, `config/`, `plugins/`) are BAKED into
> `hermes-agent` at build time — the gateway runs them from `/opt/hermes`, not from a mount.
> Editing the engine repo (or `docker cp`-ing a hotfix into a running gateway) does NOT persist:
> a `docker compose up` recreate restores the image's copy. Rebuild the image to make a change
> durable. If `hermes-agent:latest` is shared by other stacks on the host, build with
> `TAG_LATEST=0` (version tag only) or, for a single-file hotfix without re-cloning Hermes, build
> a thin derived image and point only your pack at it:
> ```dockerfile
> FROM hermes-agent:okengine-vX.Y.Z
> COPY tools/schema_validator.py /opt/hermes/tools/schema_validator.py
> COPY okengine-mcp/write_server.py /opt/hermes/okengine-mcp/write_server.py
> ```
> then set that tag as the gateway `image:` in the pack's `docker-compose.yml` and recreate only
> the gateway. (This is how okengine#46/#48's write-path guards were baked in ahead of a full rebuild.)

That single command is §1–§3 below + the `docker build`. The `okengine-reader` and
`okengine-mcp` images are separate slim images built by the pack's `docker compose`
(they're standalone — they don't need the gateway image). §1–§3 document what the
script does, if you prefer to do it by hand.

## 1. Pin Hermes
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent.git hermes
cd hermes && git checkout v2026.7.7.2         # == Hermes v0.18.2
```

## 2. Apply the carried patches (12 core-file patches)
```bash
<OKEngine>/patches/apply.sh "$PWD"           # idempotent; fails loudly on drift
```
What each patch is and why: `patches/README.md`. (The schema write-guard is the
only OKF-specific one; the rest are generic hardening/pricing.)

## 3. Install the overlay (the engine's new files — no patching)
Copy the overlay paths from the OKEngine repo onto the Hermes tree. The
**authoritative list is `engine-manifest.yaml`** (`okf_contract`, `cron_machinery`,
`ops_tooling`, `framework_cli`, `mcp_query_surface`, `reader`, plus `docs/`,
`config/`, `tools/schema_validator.py`). High level:
- `tools/schema_validator.py` — the OKF conformance contract (validator + the hook patch 01 calls).
- `okengine-mcp/` — read-only query server (`server.py`) **+** the enforced write server (`write_server.py` → `okengine-write`, G1).
- `okengine-reader/` — the human web reader.
- `scripts/` — OKF cron wake-gates, `framework.py`/`framework_validate.py`, `cron_pack_split.py`, `tier_lib.py`/`tier_refresh.py`, `kb_*`, `deploy-*`.
- `config/` — `cron-tiers.yaml`, `engine-crons.json`, `config.yaml.template`.
- `docs/okf/` — the pattern guides.

## 4. Install the plugins
- **cron-plus** — the **required** subprocess-per-job cron scheduler the engine's
  cron fleet runs on. It is a *separate Hermes plugin*, cloned by you (not vendored
  here) and **pinned** in `engine-manifest.yaml` (`dependencies.cron-plus`). Without
  it the deployed `config/cron-plus-jobs.json` (the engine + pack cron fleet) has
  nothing to schedule it. Clone it at the pin and enable it:
  ```bash
  # containerized deployment (the normal case): ensure-runtime.sh installs it automatically at
  # <pack>/.hermes-data/plugins/cron-plus (= /opt/data/plugins/cron-plus in the gateway), pinned.
  # Manual/explicit form — ALWAYS use install-cron-plus.sh, never a bare clone: it pins to the
  # manifest SHA AND applies the carried patches (job-env + after-ordering) that extension crons
  # REQUIRE (per-job env for scoped MCP tokens; after: freshness ordering). A bare clone+checkout
  # gives an UNPATCHED scheduler and silently-broken extension lanes.
  bash $ENGINE_DIR/scripts/install-cron-plus.sh <pack>
  # (for a HOST-run hermes, install into ~/.hermes/plugins/cron-plus and apply patches/cron-plus/*)
  # `cron-plus` under plugins.enabled in config.yaml (the seeded template already lists it)
  ```
- **model-provider plugins** ship in the overlay (`plugins/model-providers/custom` — the local-Ollama `reasoning_effort:none` lever; `openrouter`).

## 5. Configure
```bash
cp config/config.yaml.template ~/.hermes/config.yaml   # (or the pack's .hermes-data/config.yaml)
```
Fill the load-bearing keys (template documents all):
- `model.default` — your primary model (make it your economical workhorse; it carries every
  cron lane that doesn't override it). Which model for which lane: `docs/model-selection.md`.
- `terminal.backend: local` — **required**, or the agent can't see the vault mount.
- `mcp_servers.okengine` (read, HTTP :8730) **and** `mcp_servers.okengine-write`
  (the enforced G1 write path, stdio, no token).
- `fallback_providers` — the failover chain.
- `~/.hermes/.env` — `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, model keys, `OKENGINE_MCP_TOKEN` (mode 600).

## 6. Add a domain pack (the "task")
The engine carries no domain knowledge — a pack supplies `schema.yaml` + persona
`CLAUDE.md` + feeds + crons + `wiki/`. The pack/vault is a directory **separate
from** (sibling to) this engine checkout. Two paths:

**Use an existing catalog pack** (operator happy path — `docs/install-selected-pack.md`):
```bash
# Browse the catalog, then fetch into a SIBLING vault dir.
python scripts/framework.py list
python scripts/framework.py pull <pack> ../my-brain

# Activate ingest (packs ship feeds.opml inert).
cp ../my-brain/feeds/feeds.opml.example ../my-brain/feeds/feeds.opml
```
**Author a new pack from scratch:**
```bash
python scripts/framework.py init ../my-brain --domain "..."   # then fill it in
python scripts/framework.py validate ../my-brain              # pre-deploy check (FAIL = deploy-breaking)
```
Pack spec + quickstart: `docs/deploy-a-new-domain.md`. Don't `pull`/`init` into
this engine checkout — keep `okengine/` (code) and `my-brain/` (vault) side by side.

## 7. Deploy
Run from the **pack** dir (its `docker-compose.yml` wires all three services; `ENGINE_DIR` points
at this engine checkout). **One command** — `deploy.sh` does validate → seed runtime → install
cron-plus → build the image (if missing) → `docker compose up` → deploy crons → verify:
```bash
# HERMES_UID/HERMES_GID default to your uid (you own the clone) — export a fixed uid only for a portable/shared vault.
# Add --kickstart to populate the vault NOW instead of waiting for the schedule.
cd <pack> && bash $ENGINE_DIR/scripts/deploy.sh
```
Or step by step (exactly what `deploy.sh` runs in order):
```bash
bash $ENGINE_DIR/scripts/ensure-runtime.sh "$(pwd)"                    # seed .hermes-data/config.yaml + cron-plus + MCP token
bash $ENGINE_DIR/scripts/build-engine-image.sh                        # build hermes-agent — once per engine version
ENGINE_DIR=$ENGINE_DIR docker compose up -d --build                   # --build rebuilds reader/mcp/cockpit on an engine update (plain up -d only builds when ABSENT — #45)
CRON_PACK_DIR=$(pwd) bash $ENGINE_DIR/scripts/deploy-cron-scripts.sh   # engine + pack scripts/data -> /opt/data
CRON_PACK_DIR=$(pwd) bash $ENGINE_DIR/scripts/deploy-cron-plus-jobs.sh # cron defs -> live (self-heals next_run_at)
```
The `gateway` service consumes the prebuilt `hermes-agent` image; `compose` builds only the
standalone `okengine-reader`/`okengine-mcp` images.

## 8. Smoke (the gauntlet)
A no_agent cron succeeds; an LLM agent cron succeeds (API + tools + prompt-cache);
a delivery lands; `curl :8730/mcp` → 401 without token (read MCP up); the
`okengine-write` stdio server registers its tools; `schema-drift-lint` is green.
Then feeds → ingest → first compiled pages.

## Upgrading Hermes
Bump the pin: `git checkout <new-tag>` in the Hermes checkout, re-run
`patches/apply.sh` (rebase any patch that fails — `patches/README.md`), rebuild,
smoke-gauntlet, cut over. The overlay + plugins + pack are unaffected.
